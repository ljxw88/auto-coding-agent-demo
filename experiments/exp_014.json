  "conclusion": "OneCycleLR with max_lr=3e-3 (10x base lr) caused a regression to 80.1% (-3.9pp from baseline). Val accuracy during training reached 99.5% but LocD test accuracy was poor, confirming the val/test distribution gap observed in F7. The aggressive learning rate peak (3e-3) likely drove the model into sharp minima that generalize poorly to the LocD test distribution. The super-convergence benefit seen in classification benchmarks does not transfer to this RFFI task with its augmentation-induced domain shift.",
