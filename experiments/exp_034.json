  "conclusion": "TTA with CFO rotation (\u00b1200Hz) and AWGN (25dB) degraded accuracy by -0.5pp vs rolling best (84.5% vs 85.0%). The hypothesis was flawed: LocD test data has consistent clean capture conditions (minimal CFO, high SNR), so adding artificial CFO/AWGN jitter at test time corrupts otherwise clean signals rather than reducing prediction variance. This is consistent with the established project pattern that hardware-variation augmentations hurt on LocD. TTA could theoretically help with label-preserving augmentations only.",
