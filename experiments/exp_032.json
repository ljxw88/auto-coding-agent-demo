  "conclusion": "Increasing model width from dim=512 to dim=768 hurt accuracy by -3.2pp (81.8% vs 85%). The hypothesis that more capacity would help discriminate hard device pairs was not confirmed. This suggests the GDN with depth=4 and dim=512 is already well-sized for this 10-class fingerprinting task; wider models may overfit or the added parameters do not capture new discriminative features given the fixed focal loss training signal.",
