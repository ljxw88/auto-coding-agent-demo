  "conclusion": "Focal loss (gamma=2.0) combined with label_smoothing=0.05 achieved 85.0% on LocD test set, a +1.0pp improvement over the 84% baseline and the first improvement in 18 experiments. The focal weighting down-weighted easy samples and concentrated gradient on the hard device pairs, exactly as hypothesized. This confirms that some device pairs in the 10-class LocD problem are systematically harder, and that a loss function that explicitly targets them improves final accuracy.",
