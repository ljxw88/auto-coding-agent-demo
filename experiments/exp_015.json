  "conclusion": "Adding random U(0,2pi) constant phase rotation per burst (applied before CFO) regressed LocD test accuracy by -2.5pp to 81.5%. Despite the sound motivation (absolute phase is receiver-LO dependent and should be an invariant), this augmentation degraded generalization. The LocD test set likely has consistent phase characteristics that serve as a discriminative cue, and teaching invariance to them removes useful signal. Val accuracy during training reached ~99.6% (consistent with the val/test gap seen in prior experiments) confirming this metric is unreliable for predicting LocD test performance.",
