  "conclusion": "Stochastic depth with drop_path_rate=0.1 (linearly spaced 0.0 to 0.1 across 4 blocks) achieved 83.2%, a -0.8pp regression from the 84% baseline. However, this is the second-best result in the entire experiment history (behind A4 dual-branch at 83.5%), suggesting mild stochastic regularization helps but is insufficient alone. The result is closest to baseline of any single-architecture experiment tried \u2014 stochastic depth may be a useful building block to combine with other improvements.",
