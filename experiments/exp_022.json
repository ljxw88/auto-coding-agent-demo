  "conclusion": "stride=16 with patch_size=64 produces 512 tokens vs 257 with stride=32, nearly doubling sequence length and causing 14.83s/epoch (threshold 10s). The increased sequence length overhead is too expensive for this setup. Future attempts would need to reduce dim or depth to compensate for the longer sequence.",
