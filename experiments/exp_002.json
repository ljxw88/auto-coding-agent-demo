  "conclusion": "The dual-branch fusion hypothesis was not confirmed \u2014 accuracy dropped slightly from 84% to 83.5% (-0.5pp), within the known training instability range. Despite remarkable validation accuracy (99.5%) during training, the STFT frequency branch did not improve generalization on the LocD test set. Adding the STFT branch doubles model complexity without a meaningful accuracy gain, suggesting the GDN time-domain backbone already captures the salient RFFI features.",
