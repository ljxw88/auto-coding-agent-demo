  "conclusion": "expand_v=3.0 exceeded the 10s/epoch speed threshold at 11.76s/epoch. This is consistent with B5 (expand_v=4.0 was 12.16s/epoch). Expanding the value matrix by 50% relative to baseline (2.0) adds ~18% overhead in wall-clock time. The value matrix scaling adds O(expand_v * dim^2) memory bandwidth pressure that exceeds acceptable limits even at the conservative 3.0 setting. expand_v variants above 2.0 should not be retried.",
