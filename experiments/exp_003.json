  "conclusion": "The polar form feature channels hypothesis was not confirmed \u2014 accuracy dropped from 84% to 82.9% (-1.1pp). Explicitly appending amplitude, sin(phase), and cos(phase) channels did not provide additional discriminative information beyond what the GatedDeltaNet already extracts from raw I/Q. The 5-channel input may have made the patch embedding optimization harder, and the result falls within the known training instability range, showing no net benefit.",
