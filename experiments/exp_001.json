  "conclusion": "The IQ imbalance augmentation hypothesis was not confirmed \u2014 accuracy dropped from 84% to 80.9% (-3.1pp). The augmentation likely introduced too much receiver-side variability relative to what the test setup actually exhibits, since train and test data come from the same receiver. Artificially varying IQ imbalance may disrupt receiver-correlated features that currently aid classification rather than improve transmitter-specific fingerprinting.",
