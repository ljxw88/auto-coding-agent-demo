The background task for the full training run already completed and I processed those results in the previous session — the J1 experiment was fully completed (evaluated at 83.8%, logged as exp_044, branch cleaned up). The background task notification is just a delayed confirmation of the training that already finished.

No action needed on the output file — all results have been processed and the session is complete.
