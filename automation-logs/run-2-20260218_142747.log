Both background tasks have already been retrieved and processed during the session. The experiment is fully complete — no further action needed on those outputs.

The session ended with:
- **exp_002 (A4)** logged: 83.5% accuracy, regression, branch deleted
- All state restored: `research-config.json` back to `--arch gateddeltanet`, experiment branch deleted, `ideas_backlog.json` updated with A4 as `done`
