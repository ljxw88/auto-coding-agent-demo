The background task already completed and we already processed its result (the evaluator returned the full_train result inline). The session is complete.

**Session complete.** One experiment run end-to-end:

| Step | Result |
|------|--------|
| Idea selected | E3 — Learned Positional Embeddings |
| Branch | `experiment/E3-20260219_061946` (deleted) |
| Smoke test | PASSED — 7.39s/epoch |
| Full training | 600 epochs, ~52 min |
| LocD test accuracy | **82.4%** |
| vs rolling best | -2.6pp (regression) |
| Outcome | Regression — branch deleted |

**Key finding:** Learned positional embeddings hurt the GDN. The causal recurrent state already encodes position implicitly — adding explicit learned positional embeddings introduced conflicting signals that degraded performance. This is consistent with the broader pattern: GDN's self-sufficient state dynamics resist external augmentation of its internal state (same reason attention pooling hurt).

**Stop condition:** 8 consecutive failures (exp_019–026) exceeds `max_consecutive_failures=5`. Next session must fix `idea_generator.py` and generate new ideas before running another experiment. Only **F1 (Circular Temporal Roll)** and **B6 (Mamba-2 Backbone)** remain in the viable backlog.
