The background task has already completed and I've processed its result. The session is done.

To summarize exp_032 (G5 — Larger Model dim=768):

- **Result: 81.8%** — regression of **-3.2pp** vs rolling best (85.0%)
- Smoke test: 9.15s/epoch (just under the 10s threshold)
- Full training: 600 epochs at 6.9s/epoch
- **Hypothesis rejected**: Wider model (dim=512→768) hurt accuracy. The 10-class fingerprinting task is well-served by dim=512; extra capacity did not help and likely overfit.

**Stop condition reached**: 14 consecutive failures (exp_019–exp_032) exceeds `max_consecutive_failures=5`. Only B6 (Mamba-2 Backbone) remains as a pending idea — new idea generation (requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) will be needed before the next productive session can run.
