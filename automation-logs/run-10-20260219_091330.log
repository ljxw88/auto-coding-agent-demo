The background task was the full training run that already completed — I already processed its results. The session is complete.

## Session Summary — exp_029 Complete

**Experiment:** G1 — Auxiliary Intermediate Classification Head

| | |
|---|---|
| **Result** | REGRESSION |
| **Accuracy** | 82.9% (-2.1pp vs rolling best 85.0%) |
| **Branch** | Deleted (not kept) |
| **Smoke test** | 6.89s/epoch ✓ |

**What happened:**
- Added a shallow classification head at the GDN midpoint (after block 2 of 4), creating a second gradient path with aux_weight=0.3
- Hypothesis: intermediate supervision would regularize representations and improve final accuracy (as in GoogLeNet)
- Reality: with only depth=4, the intermediate state at block 2 is too early in the recurrent computation — the GDN hasn't integrated enough temporal context for a meaningful auxiliary signal. The conflicting gradients degraded the final representation quality.

**Stop condition:** 11 consecutive failures (exp_019–exp_029) exceeds `max_consecutive_failures=5`.

**Remaining backlog:** G3 (STFT embedding), G4 (focal gamma=1.5), G5 (dim=768) — to be run in subsequent sessions.
