The background task was already completed and I processed its result earlier in the session. The training finished successfully with status "ok" (4.6s/epoch average), which led to the evaluation showing 83.3% accuracy (regression). The experiment has been fully logged as exp_041 and cleaned up.

No action needed — the session is complete.
