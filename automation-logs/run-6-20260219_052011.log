The background task notification is just confirming what already completed — the full training result was already captured (5.4s/epoch, status ok). No action needed.

The session is complete. Here's the full summary:

## Session Complete — exp_025: D5 Attention Pooling

**Idea**: D5 — Change `--pooling last` → `--pooling attn`

| Step | Result |
|------|--------|
| Smoke test | OK — 6.56s/epoch (threshold: 10s) |
| Full training | OK — 600 epochs, 5.4s/epoch avg |
| LocD test accuracy | **81.1%** |
| vs rolling best (85.0%) | **-3.9pp — REGRESSION** |
| Branch | Deleted |

**Conclusion**: Attention pooling over all tokens hurts the causal GDN model. The last-token recurrent state already aggregates the full sequence through the delta-rule memory mechanism, making learned weighted aggregation redundant and harmful. `--pooling last` remains optimal.

**Stop condition triggered**: 7 consecutive failures (exp_019–exp_025) exceeds `max_consecutive_failures=5`.

**Next session priorities**:
1. Fix `idea_generator.py` (KeyError in prompt template) and generate new ideas
2. Remaining viable backlog ideas: **E3** (Learned Positional Embeddings), **F1** (Circular Temporal Roll), **B6** (Mamba-2 Backbone)
3. Rolling best remains **85.0%** — target is 86%+
