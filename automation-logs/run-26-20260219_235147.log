The task already completed successfully — I already processed the full training result (status: ok, 4.15s/epoch average) and proceeded through evaluation, logging, and cleanup. The background task notification confirms the tmux session exited cleanly with code 0, which is consistent with what the evaluator already reported.

The session is complete. Here's the final summary:

**exp_049 — J5 Warmup LR Schedule: 84.3% (REGRESSION -0.8pp)**

**STOP: `max_consecutive_failures=5` reached** (J1→J2→J3→J4→J5 all non-improvements). Backlog is also empty. Human intervention needed to generate new ideas with `python agents/idea_generator.py --count 5` (requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).
