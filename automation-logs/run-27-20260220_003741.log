Now I have a clear picture. Let me check the stop conditions:
- **max_experiments = 50**, we have **49 experiments** (exp_001 through exp_049)
- **max_consecutive_failures = 5**: J1 (regression), J2 (regression), J3 (failed), J4 (regression), J5 (regression) = 5 consecutive non-improvements
- **Ideas backlog = 0 pending**: Cannot generate new ideas without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

All three stop conditions are met/blocking:

1. ✅ Max consecutive failures (5) triggered after exp_049
2. ✅ Ideas backlog is empty and cannot be refreshed (no API key)
3. The experiment count is at 49/50 — one slot remains but no ideas available

🚫 BLOCKED — Human intervention required

**Current state:** All stop conditions from the previous session have been reached.

**Status:**
- **49 experiments completed** (max_experiments=50, 1 slot remains)
- **0 pending ideas** in backlog (all 49 ideas exhausted)
- **5 consecutive non-improvements** triggered `max_consecutive_failures` stop condition after exp_049 (J5 LR warmup: 84.3%)
- **Rolling best: 85.1%** (exp_037 H2, head_dim=128, num_heads=4)
- **Target (86%) NOT reached**

**Blocking reason:** `idea_generator.py` requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable to generate new experiment ideas. Without it, the backlog cannot be refreshed.

**What's needed:**
1. Set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable so `python agents/idea_generator.py --count 5` can run and populate new ideas
2. Optionally: decide whether to continue past the 5-consecutive-failures stop condition or reset the counter by manually adding ideas to `ideas_backlog.json`
3. Optionally: increase `max_consecutive_failures` in `research-config.json` if the intent is to continue searching

**After resolving:** Re-run the research session — the agent will generate new ideas and proceed with experiment 50.

---

**Session Summary:**
- Session loaded context and confirmed all stop conditions from prior session are active
- Rolling best remains **85.1%** (exp_037 H2)
- All 49 ideas from the original backlog have been exhausted across J-series and prior experiments
- No experiment was run this session due to blocked conditions
