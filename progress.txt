# Auto Research Agent — Progress Log

## 2026-02-18 — Setup

### Environment
- Example research project: CIFAR-10 image classification with SmallCNN (3 conv blocks, no batch norm)
- Dataset: CIFAR-10, 10K training subset (for ~4s/epoch on MPS)
- Smoke test gate: 10 epochs, reject if >10s/epoch
- Full training: 500 epochs

### Baseline
- Accuracy: 0.4828 (48.28%) after 5-epoch warm-up
- Loss: 1.4056
- Optimizer: Adam, lr=0.001, weight_decay=1e-4
- No batch normalization, no LR schedule

### Initial Ideas Seeded
- idea_001: Add Batch Normalization after each Conv layer (expected: high impact)
- idea_002: Switch to Cosine Annealing LR schedule (expected: medium impact)

### Next
- Run: ./run-research.sh 2
